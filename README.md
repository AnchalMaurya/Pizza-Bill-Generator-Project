## 🍕 Pizza Bill Generator

A simple **Java-based** console application that generates a detailed pizza bill using **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.

This project demonstrates how real-world entities (like pizzas and toppings) can be modeled in code using Java classes and methods.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The Pizza Bill Generator allows users to:

Create a pizza (vegetarian or non-vegetarian)

Add extra cheese, toppings, or takeaway packaging

Automatically calculate the total cost

Generate a detailed bill at the end

The project focuses on clean OOP design rather than UI, making it a great beginner-friendly example of class-based programming in Java.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Choose between Veg and Non-Veg pizza
✅ Add extra cheese and toppings
✅ Option for takeaway (adds packaging charges)
✅ Auto-calculated bill with all itemized charges
✅ Encapsulated class structure with clear responsibilities
✅ Easy to extend (e.g., add new pizza types or discounts)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

IDE : IntelliJ IDEA
